If you already have Git installed, you can get the latest development version via Git itself:

Installations
-------------
It's highly recommended that you install BorNeo as a package (including all the correct dependencies).

This is best done with [Bower](http://bower.io/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.org)
- [Bower](http://bower.io/), a package manager for client side libraries use in the web.
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.org), a package manager for Node.js libraries and applications.

### Install Bower Packages
Root folder containing a program described by a
[bower.json](https://github.com/waynecheah/borneo/blob/master/bower.json) file.

Install the packages with bower install. Bower installs packages to /app/bower_components/.
```
$ bower install
```

### Install Node Package Manager (NPM)
Root folder containing a program described by a
[package.json](https://github.com/waynecheah/borneo/blob/master/package.json) file.

Install the packages with npm install. NPM installs packages to /node_modules/.
```
$ npm install
```

This command installs all required packages, and any packages that it depends on.
If the package has a shrinkwrap file, the installation of dependencies will be driven by that.
See [npm-shrinkwrap](https://www.npmjs.org/doc/cli/npm-shrinkwrap.html).
